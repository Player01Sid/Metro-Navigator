----

## Tech Stack
- Python
- C

## Implementation
Implemented core functionalities by programming functions is **C**. Also used **Dijkstra's algorithm** to find the optimum route from start station to destination station. 
Carried C functionalities in a **DLL** file and used them by **Python** to provide a Graphical User Interface for navigation and routing. Python programs calls C functions to perform the algorithm to get the route and display the graphical representation of the route with approprite Station colors and points where train needs to be changed.
